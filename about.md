knowledge and experience in the design and development of products with embedded
systems composed of hardware, firmware and software and also programming using structured languages, OOP or
Assembler.
I worked for 19 years in automotive aftermarket, with 14 years in product engineering for vehicle diagnostics. I developed
hardware (HW), software’s (SW) and firmware’s (FW) and also did the integration of the systems.
The systems had analog interfaces with sample acquisition speeds of 20MSPS and processors (DSP) for mathematical
processing of the signals and a multicore architecture integrated through communication SPI Bus.
Protocols development using RS 485 or IEEE 802.15.4 as a physical layer in a network with star topology.
I developed the full stack diagnostic application. Participation in distributed, multidisciplinary
and multicultural development environments.
